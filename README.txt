Welcome to Binary PewPew Map!

This is a collection of scripts which extract the call graph of a binary using either Ghidra, IDAPro or Binary Ninja as JSON graphs. Those graphs can then be visualized using the included d3_graphviz_pewpew.html, a D3 directed graph visualization that provides an interactive graph. And to keep it funny, turn the sound on and enjoy the pewpewpew effect.

The code in this repo has been almost entirely generated by Claude Code. I vibe coded. The only thing written from scratch is the Ghidra graph extractor. Refrain from hosting this code anywhere third parties can mess with it. Oh and, I do not assume any responsibility for any of this :)

These scripts were written and testes to run on Windows and parse Linux executables. Good luck with other platforms, and let me know how it goes if it goes. Oh and, if you wonder where the radare2 extractor is at, I worked on that in 2016, there was no AI to write that, or maintain it whatsoever, anyway its still available here https://github.com/pinkflawd/r2graphity. 

Dependencies

BinaryNinja pro license for binjaviz.py (for scripting support)
IDAPro license for idaviz.py (for scripting support)
Ghidra is free, including the API :) 

Python3, json and networkx Python packages, binaryninja Python package for Binja support. 

For use of ghidraviz.py install Python packages within the PyGhidra pyenv. Launch PyGhidra from <GHIDRADIR>/support/pyghidraRun, run script from script manager. 

Usage

Create folder for output graphs and change folderpath in your extractor script of choice. That path is hardcoded, I was lazy.

Ghidra: Start pyghidraRun, open binary, load ghidraviz.py in script manager, run
IDAPro: Open binary in IDAPro, under File -> Script file run idaviz.py 
Binary Ninja: Run binjaviz.py directly on cmd line, binary file as argument 

Open d3_graphviz_pewpew.html in a browser, load .json graph, click click pew pew. 

ghidraviz and idaviz can also be run via command line with minor changes, for automation purposes.
